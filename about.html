                <p class="py-3">
                  Established in 2011, Wiki.ezvid.com is a free-to-use video
                  wiki published by the California technology company Ezvid Inc.
                  Wikis are generally architected around a video, whereby a user
                  is introduced to a concept in the space of a four-to-seven
                  minute video presentation, and then additional text, images,
                  data, and links to third-party information sources are
                  provided to add more detail to each topic. The gentle nature
                  of Ezvid's introductions to thousands of topics renders the
                  Wiki particularly useful for teaching environments. Ezvid Wiki
                  evolved from the message board surrounding Ezvid For Windows,
                  first released in 2010. In those years it has grown from a
                  small user-generated forum into the largest and most
                  comprehensive video wiki on the planet, providing useful,
                  unbiased information and actionable guidance to hundreds of
                  millions of users around the world, in thousands of knowledge
                  categories.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In December, 2020, a product team at Google determined that
                  Ezvid Wiki's service competed too directly with Google's
                  in-house product advertising services, and manually demoted
                  our pages in Google's search results, along with the pages of
                  several similar websites. On one day, our incoming traffic,
                  and traffic to many similar websites, went down by 85%.
                  Updates to the Wiki are currently on hold, as we await the
                  outcome of anti-trust litigation against Google in the United
                  States on a federal and state level.
